                        <h3>What is Bouldering?</h3>
                        <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock
                            walls
                            without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
                    
                        <p>Unlike <a href="../css-learn/get-ready-page.html">traditional climbing,</a> bouldering focuses on short
                            but
                            intensive routes called "problems,"
                            typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging
                            sequences of moves.</p>
